Hi there! I'm Tilley, a finance professional with a background in ETFs who's passionate about coding and building useful technology. I created this secure password manager as part of my journey into software engineering, combining my interest in cybersecurity with practical problem solving. This project showcases my growing technical skills while addressing a critical digital security challenge that affects millions of users worldwide.

## My Journey

My professional background lies in finance, where I specialised in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). While working in the financial sector, I developed strong analytical skills and an appreciation for systems that protect sensitive information.

Recently, I've embarked on an exciting transition into software engineering. I'm actively pursuing a career change into the tech industry, leveraging my analytical background while developing new technical skills. I'm currently immersed in web development, learning to build secure, efficient applications that solve real world problems. What drives me is the perfect blend of logical problem solving and creative thinking that coding offers.

I'm naturally curious and thrive on continuous learning. Each new technology I explore opens up possibilities for creating more sophisticated, user friendly solutions. This password manager project represents my commitment to building technology that's not just technically sound but genuinely helpful to users.

The increasing frequency of data breaches and credential-based attacks highlighted in recent cybersecurity reports inspired me to create a tool that addresses these challenges while demonstrating my programming skills. Through this project, I've applied principles of secure application development, implemented encryption protocols, and designed an intuitive interface that makes good security practices accessible.

I'm excited about growing as a developer and contributing to projects that make a positive impact. I'm actively seeking opportunities in the tech industry where I can apply my unique combination of financial knowledge and programming skills. Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn to discuss this project, potential opportunities, or other tech topics!
